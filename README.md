# Volleyball Statistics Scraper
This Python script is designed to scrape volleyball statistics from the 'Volleyball Nations League 2022' website, using the Selenium library. The script navigates through the website, collects data from the "Best Attackers" statistics table, and then converts the collected data into a Pandas DataFrame.
## Notes
* The script's functionality relies on the structure and elements of the website. Any changes to the website structure may require adjustments to the script.
* The MAX_CLICKS variable controls the number of times the script will click the "See more" button to load additional data. 
* The scraped data is organized into a Pandas DataFrame, making it easy to analyze, manipulate, and export the data to different formats.
